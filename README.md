[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/danielpearson90/vmacfeaturesearch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/danielpearson90/vmacfeaturesearch)

This repository contains the data and analysis code for our project investigating whether overt attention to reward-related distractors can be suppressed under feature search conditions.

This repository contains data files that have been derived from the raw eye-tracker data. The raw eye-gaze files are very large and so are not stored here. They can be found at: <https://osf.io/yrdzv/>.

Our pre-print is online here:

### How to download or install

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL: <https://github.com/danielpearson90/vmacfeaturesearch/archive/master.zip>

Once you have downloaded and extracted the compendium, you can open [the project](vmacfeaturesearch.Rproj) with RStudio, and knit [analysis\_report.rmd](analysis/analysis_report.rmd) to produce a report containing all statistical analyses contained in our preprint. You can also knit [paper.Rmd](analysis/paper/paper.Rmd) to produce a reproducible copy of the preprint.

This compendium is still a work in progress, with Docker integration planned for the future.
