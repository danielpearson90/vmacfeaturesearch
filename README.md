[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/danielpearson90/vmacfeaturesearch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/danielpearson90/vmacfeaturesearch)

This repository contains the data and analysis code for our project investigating whether overt attention to reward-related distractors can be suppressed under feature search conditions.

This repository contains data files that have been derived from the raw eye-tracker data. The raw eye-gaze files are very large and so are not stored here. They can be found at: <https://osf.io/yrdzv/>.

Our pre-print is online here:

> Pearson, D., Watson, P., Cheng, P., & Le Pelley, M. (2019). *Overt attentional capture by reward-related stimuli overcomes inhibitory suppression*. Name of journal/book, Accessed 24 Apr 2019. Online at <https://doi.org/xxx/xxx>
